# SleepingBarberProblem
Capstone Project for IT3070E | Operating System


Description: This project involves the creation of a simulation program to represent the Sleeping Barber problem. The program utilizes Python's threading module and semaphores to mimic the concurrent interactions between customers and the barber in a barber shop setting. Through this simulation, we aim to gain insights into the complexities of managing shared resources and maintaining order in a parallel processing environment.
